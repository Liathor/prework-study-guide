        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers. Not all elements are semantic. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are examples.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt; elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. </li>
          <li>The &lt;img&gt; element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The &lt;img&gt; element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The &lt;a&gt; element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTML's &lt;head&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b <i>branch-name</i>: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages your changes; commits all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "<i>notes on what you changed</i>": commits the changes, we use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Syncs your local branch with the remote branch in GitHub. This is especially important in a team environment in case a team member has added a new feature to the project. The process of syncing and merging code into the GitHub repo is how the project gets continually updated with more features and content from different team members.</li>
          <li>git push origin <i>branch-name</i>: pushes up all changes</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switch to the main branch</li>
