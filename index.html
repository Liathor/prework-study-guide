        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers. Not all elements are semantic. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are examples.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt; elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. </li>
          <li>The &lt;img&gt; element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The &lt;img&gt; element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The &lt;a&gt; element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b <i>branch-name</i>: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages your changes; commits all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "<i>notes on what you changed</i>": commits the changes, we use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Syncs your local branch with the remote branch in GitHub. This is especially important in a team environment in case a team member has added a new feature to the project. The process of syncing and merging code into the GitHub repo is how the project gets continually updated with more features and content from different team members.</li>
          <li>git push origin <i>branch-name</i>: pushes up all changes</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switch to the main branch</li>
